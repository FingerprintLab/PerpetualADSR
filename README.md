# Perpetual ADSR

This is a fully analog eurorack module that generates a looped envelope. After the attack and until the release, the module enters in a 2-state function bouncing between a high and a low value. The user can set the attack voltage, the central value and the time for each step to complete.  
This module works also without a `TRIGGER` signal since it can be generated from the `GATE`.
